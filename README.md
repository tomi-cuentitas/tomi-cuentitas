## üßë‚Äçüî¨ About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the Instituto de F√≠sica La Plata (CONICET), Argentina, and an Invited Researcher at the Institut f√ºr Theoretische Physik (Universit√§t Ulm), Germany. My research focuses on classical simulation techniques for many-body quantum systems.  

My dissertation revolves around utilizing and developing the Maximum-Entropy (Max-Ent) principle as a controllable, scalable, and adaptive simulation scheme. During my work with M.B. Plenio's group, I explore Bayesian methods for tensor network simulations of critical systems.
