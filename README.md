My research focuses on classical simulation techniques for many-body quantum systems. My dissertation revolves around utilizing and developing the Maximum-Entropy (Max-Ent) principle as a controllable, scalable, and adaptive simulation scheme. During my work with M.B. Plenio's group, I explore Bayesian methods for tensor network simulations of critical systems. --- ## 🧪 Research Interests - Classical Simulation of Quantum Many-Body Dynamics - Maximum-Entropy (Max-Ent) Projections as a Simulation Technique - Tensor Network Simulations (Post-**M**atrix **P**roduct **S**tates methods: PEPS, WGS, Belief Propagation) - Open Quantum Systems and their Simulation --- ## 📜 Thesis - **Ph.D. Dissertation** (Expected graduation: July 2026) *Efficient Simulation of Dynamics of Quantum Systems* --- ## 📚 Publications - **F.T.B.
