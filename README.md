## Research Focus

I am a Ph.D. candidate in theoretical and computational quantum physics working on **classical simulation methods for many-body quantum systems**.

My dissertation develops **Maximum-Entropy (Max-Ent) projection techniques** as a controllable, scalable, and adaptive framework for simulating quantum dynamics.  

During my research stay in **M. B. Plenio’s group (Universität Ulm)**, I explore **Bayesian approaches to tensor-network simulations**, with emphasis on critical quantum systems and uncertainty-aware numerical methods.
